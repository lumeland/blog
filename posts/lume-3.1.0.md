## Lume is moving to jsDelivr

For the past 5 years, Lume's main distribution channel has been
[deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x), the CDN created by Deno to distribute
packages using HTTP imports. This package registry has been deprecated in favor
of [JSR](https://jsr.io/), a new registry that doesn't support HTTP. Since Deno
doesn't want people to use `deno.land/x` (as indicated in the two
[big yellow banners in the page to add new modules](https://deno.com/add_module))
and migration to JSR is not an option, we decided to switch to a different CDN.

**jsDelivr** is the obvious choice for many reasons:

- It's supported by Deno
  [without any configuration](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/#importing-from-the-web).
- It's already used to
  [publish LumeCMS](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lumeland/cms/), deliver the
  development versions of Lume, and fetch some assets like icons or CSS code,
  needed by some plugins.
- It has a nice
  [landing page for each package](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/lumeland/lume),
  where you can see all the files, and statistics, something not possible in
  deno.land/x. We can even see statistics per file, which let us know the
  plugins most frequently used.
- The traffic is balanced by different CDN sponsors like Cloudflare, Fastly,
  Bunny.net, etc, which ensure performance and reduce risks of relying on a
  single CDN.
- All content is permanently cached to ensure reliability. Even if the files get
  deleted from GitHub, they will continue to work on jsDelivr without breaking
  anything.

Lume will still be published on `deno.land/x`, the only difference is that the
script to update or initialize a new Lume project will choose jsDelivr by
default. That's one of the many benefits of using HTTP imports: its
decentralized nature allows you to change the cdn at any moment with zero
impact.

## Better integration with LumeCMS

One of the main challenges with LumeCMS has been integrating it smoothly with
Lume or other static site generators. Previously, LumeCMS relied on **Hono** to
run both the CMS and the page preview, which could lead to inconsistencies: a
page served by Lume (`deno task serve`) might differ from one served by LumeCMS,
since Hono's static server doesn't exactly match Lume's. For example,
middlewares configured for Lume are not available in the CMS and this affects to
features like live reload, debugbar etc.

### Moved to middleware

With version 0.13, LumeCMS introduces significant changes, including replacing
Hono with a [simpler router](https://github.com/oscarotero/galo). Now, LumeCMS
is a middleware on top of Lume's server, handling only requests that start with
`/admin/*` while delegating page previews to Lume's server. This makes the
integration easier, eliminating the need for separate commands
(`deno task serve` and `deno task cms`). In fact, if a `_cms.ts` file is
present, the CMS is automatically included when running `deno task serve`.

### Improved VPS configuration

When LumeCMS is running on a VPS, it requires two processes:

- The main process is an HTTP server that is always listening.
- The secondary process runs Lume and LumeCMS.

The main process starts the secondary process on demand and works as a reverse
proxy. This allows restarting Lume and LumeCMS after some changes (for example,
when updating the changes with `git pull` or after changing the git branch)
without closing the server.

Until now, you needed to use
[`lume_cms_adapter`](https://deno.land/x/lume_cms_adapter) package to configure
it. Now it's much easier since Lume's main repo includes a module to run the CMS
in production: You only need to run `deno serve -A lume/serve.ts` and that's
all!!

## New plugin: `validate_html`

This plugin checks the HTML code of your site and validates it using
[html-validate](https://html-validate.org/), a fast NPM package that works
offline.

The plugin was originally
[created by dish](https://git.pyrox.dev/pyrox/new-blog/src/commit/af1de59ce89084064e2973e0d8d3e095e1b2534a/plugins/validateHTML.ts)
and now it's an official Lume plugin, integrated with the Debug bar and with
different options to export the report.

The easiest way to use it is importing it in the `_config.ts` file:

```ts
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import validateHtml from "lume/plugins/validate_html.ts";

const site = lume();
site.use(validateHtml());

export default site;
```

Now you will see a new tab in the Debug bar with all HTML errors detected in the
site:

I hope this plugin will help you to create more standard and bug-free websites.

## New plugin: `partytown`

[Partytown](https://partytown.qwik.dev/) is a JavaScript library to run third
party scripts into a web worker. The goal is dedicating the main thread to your
code, and move other resource-intesive third party scripts, like analytics or
tracking services to a different thread, making the website faster and more
secure.

The plugin was created originally
[by kwaa 2 years ago](https://github.com/lumeland/experimental-plugins/pull/21)
as an experimental plugin and now it has moved to the main repo. To use it, you
have to register it in the _config.ts file:

```ts
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import partytown from "lume/plugins/partytown.ts";

const site = lume();
site.use(partytown());

export default site;
```

And now add the `type="text/partytown"` attribute to all scripts that you want
to run from a web worker:

```html
<script type="text/partytown">...</script>
```

## Improved remote files

The [function `remoteFile`](https://lume.land/docs/core/remote-files/) allows
the use of URLs to download the content of a file if it doesn't exist locally.
For example:

```js
site.remoteFile("/styles/styles.css", "https://example.com/styles/styles.css");
```

If the file `/my/styles.css` doesn't exist locally, the content of the URL will
be used in place. This is very useful for themes because it allows for placing
all templates and styles used by a theme remotely.

The only problem with this function is that it only works for single files. If
you have several files, you need to call the function once per file:

```js
const files = [
  "styles.css",
  "components/button.css",
  "components/alert.css",
  "components/icons.css",
];

for (const file of files) {
  site.remoteFile("/styles/" + file, "https://example.com/styles/" + file);
}
```

### New `site.remote()` function

Lume 3.1 includes the new function `site.remote()` similar to
`site.remoteFile()` but allows to register more than one file:

```js
const files = [
  "styles.css",
  "components/button.css",
  "components/alert.css",
  "components/icons.css",
];

site.remote("/styles/", "https://example.com/styles/", files);
```

Okay, you may think this isn't a big improvement, it's just a bit simpler. But
the good news is that you can use some specifiers that are compatible with glob
patterns:

- `npm:` to use NPM packages (like `npm:lucide-static@0.544.0`)
- `gh:` to use GitHub repositories (like `gh:lumeland/theme-simple-wiki`)
- `file:` to use local files
- All URLs starting with `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/`.

For example, let's say the CSS files are stored in a GitHub repository:

```js
const files = [
  "/styles/**/*.css",
];

site.remote("/styles/", "gh:username/repo@tag", files);
```

That's better now! Under the hood, this is possible thanks to the API of
JsDelivr. Any compatible specifier is converted to JsDelivr equivalent.

For example, `gh:lumeland/theme-simple-wiki@0.14.3` is converted to
[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lumeland/theme-simple-wiki@0.14.3/](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lumeland/theme-simple-wiki@0.14.3/).
And using the JsDelivr API, we can know the paths of all files in the repository
([example](ttps://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/gh/lumeland/theme-simple-wiki@v0.14.3?structure=flat)),
so we can filter them using the glob pattern.

### Create themes is now easier

Thanks to this new function, it's easier to create Lume themes, since you don't
have to worry about forgetting to include a new file that was recently created.
Let's see this example:

```js
const themeFiles = [
  "/_includes/**",
  "/*.css",
  "/*.js",
  "/*.vto",
];

site.remote("/", import.meta.resolve("./"), themeFiles);
```

In local development, `import.meta.resolve("./")` resolves to a `file://...`
url, so the glob patterns work great. If this package is published and imported
from JsDelivr, it's resolved to `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@tag`, and
the glob patterns are still supported thanks to the JsDelivr API. This is
another reason to recommend distributing Deno packages on JsDelivr over
deno.land/x.

> [!note]
>
> For backward compatibility, the function `site.remoteFile` is still available
> as an alias of `site.remote`, for example, `site.remoteFile(local, remote)` is
> an alias of `site.remote(local, remote)`.

## Inline plugin works with CSS files

As of Lume 3.1, the [inline](https://lume.land/plugins/inline/) plugin not only
processes HTML files but also CSS. This allows to inline easily background
images. To use it, just append the `?inline` parameter to the file url. For
example:

```css
.warning {
  background-image: url("/icons/warning.svg?inline");
}
```

is converted to:

```css
.warning {
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg...</svg>");
}
```
