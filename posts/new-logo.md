Lume was born 5 years ago as an excuse to try Deno, the new JavaScript runtime.
At that moment, the hype around Deno led to many projects featuring a dinosaur
in their logo. Lume joined this trend, making a joke with the concept of _fire_
and _Deno_.

I've wanted to change the logo for a long time, and finally, I could manage some
time to work on that. There are many reasons for this change:

- The Lume logo is based on [the original logo](https://deno.com/artwork) of
  Deno, which has changed twice since then.
- Some people think Lume is a Deno product.
- The logo doesn't work for small sizes.

## The _vagalume_

For the new logo, I wanted to focus on the main concept of Lume: **the fire**. I
didn't want to create yet another logo with a flame. Instead, I still wanted a
pet, but a firefly instead of a dinosaur.

Interestingly enough, in Galician, a firefly is called _vagalume_, which makes
sense for a project called Lume.

## Logo design

The new logo is more geometric, created with a leaf shape repeated five times,
and a head with two antennae. This simple design makes it work better at small
sizes.

The red color is used to represent the fire that emits light (using a gradient).
It also works in dark and light contexts, just inverting the black and white
colors:

The font family used didn't change. It's still
[Epilogue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Epilogue?preview.text=Lume), a
beautiful sans-serif font with a great x-height. I only made some kerning tweaks
and the name is now "Lume" (with upper case L) instead of "lume".

Thanks to [José Luis Antúnez](https://jlantunez.com/) for the feedback and
suggestions, and to Studio Ghibli for the film
[Grave of the Fireflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies)
from which I got some inspiration.
